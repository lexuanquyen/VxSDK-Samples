## Pelco VideoXpert SDK Samples

Here you will find sample applications that provide examples on how to develop applications using the VideoXpert SDK.

### Note for x64 applications:

Due to the file size limit on GitHub you must manually unzip libgstlibav.zip located in MediaController/ThirdParty/GStreamer/1.8.1/x64/gstreamer_runtime/lib/gstreamer-1.0/ to that same directory.  Streaming will be unavailable for x64 applications until this file has been extracted.

## Requirements

* VideoXpert SDK
